# LLM-Dataset-Generator
1.* Creating datasets for fine-tuning an LLM can be a daunting task and not so enjoyable :(
* Hence, I created and deployed an app called LLM Dataset Generator where you can upload your PDF file and create training and validation datasets and download it in 2 most widely used fine-tuning dataset formats, csv and json.

2.‚ú® Key Features:
* Automated Q&A pair generation from PDF inputs
* OpenAI model integration (customizable for other models)
* Flexible Training-Validation split options
* Export in CSV and JSONL formats
* User-friendly Streamlit interface

3.üõ†Ô∏è How It Works:
* Upload your PDF
* Add your API key
* Select your preferred model
* Define the number of Q&A pairs
* Customize context (optional)
* Generate your dataset!
